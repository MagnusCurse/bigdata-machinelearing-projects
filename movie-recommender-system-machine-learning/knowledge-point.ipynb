    "The purpose of `CountVectorizer` from the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module is to convert a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts (also known as a \"document-term matrix\"). In simple terms, it transforms text data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: It splits text into individual tokens (usually words), which are used as features for further analysis.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization**: It converts the tokens into numeric vectors. Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies or occurrences in that document.\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction**: The tokens are treated as features, allowing text to be used in machine learning models, such as classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have two documents:\n",
    "- \"I love programming\"\n",
    "- \"I love machine learning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`CountVectorizer` will:\n",
    "- Create a vocabulary: ['I', 'love', 'programming', 'machine', 'learning']\n",
    "- Create a document-term matrix (each row represents a document, and each column represents a word):\n",
    "  \n",
    "| Document  | I | love | programming | machine | learning |\n",
    "|-----------|---|------|-------------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| Doc 1     | 1 | 1    | 1           | 0       | 0        |\n",
    "| Doc 2     | 1 | 1    | 0           | 1       | 1        |\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix shows how frequently each word appears in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Parameters:\n",
    "- `max_features`: Limits the number of features (words) to the most frequent ones.\n",
    "- `stop_words`: Ignores common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc., which may not be useful for analysis.\n",
    "- `ngram_range`: Allows for the use of n-grams (pairs or triples of words), rather than just single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `CountVectorizer` is a simple but effective tool for transforming text data into a format suitable for machine learning tasks like text classification or clustering."
